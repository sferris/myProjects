# myProjects

My attempt at figuring out MEAN + ui-router + material

 * Install Node per your OS's instructions
 * Install bower globally: npm install bower -g
 * Install nodemon globally: npm install nodemon -g
 * Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/sferris/myProjects.git
 * Install node modules: cd myProjects; npm install
 * Install bower modules: cd myProjects/app; bower install
 * Run the app: cd myProjects; make

As for mongo:

 * Install mongodb per your OS's instructions
 * install the sample data: cd myProjects; mongo < data/col-projects.js

```
   MongoDB shell version: 2.6.7
   connecting to: test
   connection to 127.0.0.1
   connecting to: localhost/myProjects
   myProjects
   true
   BulkWriteResult({
           "writeErrors" : [ ],
           "writeConcernErrors" : [ ],
           "nInserted" : 3,
           "nUpserted" : 0,
           "nMatched" : 0,
           "nModified" : 0,
           "nRemoved" : 0,
           "upserted" : [ ]
   })
   bye
